# Hi nice to meet you 👋
My name is Pedro Levi, and I’m a Fullstack Developer with experience in React.js, JavaScript, Node.js, SQL, and other modern web technologies.
I recently graduated in Systems Analysis and Development (ADS) at UNOESTE, and I am currently in the final stage of my English course at CCAA.
At the moment, I’m actively developing my skills through several personal and academic projects, continually improving both my backend and frontend capabilities. I’m always exploring new technologies, tools, and best practices to elevate the quality of my work.
I have solid hands-on experience in building fullstack applications and enjoy transforming ideas into functional, well-structured solutions.
